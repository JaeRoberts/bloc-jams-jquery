# Bloc Jams
A starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app


**Bloc Jams** is a starter project I was assigned during my design apprenticeship with Bloc that allowed me to exercise the JavaScript and jQuery knowledge I gained in the program through developing a web playlist.

The objective of the project was to:
- Analyze an existing codebase.
- Understand the process of accessing data in JavaScript objects and inserting it into DOM elements
- Recognize and use some jQuery methods such as `.text()`, `.attr()`, and `.click()`
- Assess a problem and attempt to devise a solution in pseudocode or English
- Translate the pseudocode or English solution into JavaScript
- Recognize and use various jQuery methods â€“ such as `.html(),` `.text(),` etc
- Write a function that implements complex application behavior
- Use the `.indexOf()` method to retrieve the index of a matching array item
- Work with range inputs
- Create event handler's with jQuery's `.on()` method
- Use `setInterval` to execute code at regular intervals
- Calculate a percentage from two values and apply the percentage to a range input
- Use jQuery's `.val()` method to update range input values
